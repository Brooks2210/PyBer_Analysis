## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of the PyBer analysis was to take a closer look at the PyBer ride sharing business by analyzing the types of cities they currently operate in, the number of drivers per city, and the fares charged for each city. The executives at PyBer want to determine if they are allocating proper resources to each city and what changes can be made to make them more profitable.  

## Results
The initial results of the data are what would be expected for a ride sharing business operating out of urban, suburban, and rural cities. The overwhelming number of fares comes from urban cities, but it should be noted that the average price of each fare is the lowest among the different types of cities. This can be explained by the length of each trip. In contrast, rural cities had fewer fares, but the average cost of each fare was the highest of the three city categories. Suburban cities fit right in between the urban city and rural city results. A detailed line chart can be seen below showing the different city types and the amount of fares for each type.

## Summary
Based on the PyBer analysis, three recommendations can be made to improve and expand business operations. After a closer examination of the drives per city category it can be determined that it takes approximately 1.5 drives to complete one fare. While in a rural setting and a suburban setting it takes .62 and .78 drivers, respectively. It is recommended that PyBer reduce the number of urban drives to reduce cost. A second recommendation would be to expand into more rural cities. The average fare for a rural city was $55.00 compared to $16.50 in an urban city. While demand might be more in an urban city, the large fare price of a rural city cannot be ignored. A final recommendation would be to staff drives based on historical trends for a given day. New Years day and other major holidays including weekends could be times when the company has the max amount of drivers available and then reduces drives for slow periods. By staffing based on historical trends, PyBer can save on cost and prepare for when they need all hands on board.
